# Hello there âœ‹ 
This repository is from a challenging week promoted by the NLW team.
## About the Event ðŸš€ðŸš€
NLW is an online event with lots of code, challenges, networking and a single purpose: to take you to the next level - it is also their slogan.

This event is not the first edition and, during the year, they have many free online events where you can learn and practice to level up and boost your career.

Thus, this week is a fast-paced, intensive mini-course full of techniques and tips using the most trending tools in the market. This week was designed to help us out to take the next step as a programmer.

# About the application developed
In the React path, we are developing a webpage application where the users can set timers - as in the Pomodoro methodology - to do a few things and is rewarded with experiences points and then level up, just as in an RPG game.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to get started ðŸ’»

First, you need to download and install [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/). 
Within the Node.js installed on your computer, you will open the [Git Bash] (https://gitforwindows.org/) and find the directory where you saved the 'moveit-next' folder.
For example:
```bash
cd /d/moveit-next/
```
With this stage done, you are able to run the development server by yping the following commands in the bash:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Then you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to play with the application. <br>
To end it open the bash again and press Cntrl + c.
